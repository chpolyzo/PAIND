Projects and notebooks for the AIPND Udacity nanodegree.
This is a repository keeping information regarding the Python for AI Nanodegree. You can find different notebooks I prefer
to keep here for future use as they have been very helpful during the project. My work has been developed in the 
Image Claxxifier Project.ipynb file. To run the code you need to import os (https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html), 
PyTorch (https://pytorch.org/), pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/),numpy (https://numpy.org/) and some other helper libraries 
provided by UDACITY. We have been using the iris flower dataset (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) 
to train a newral network capable to predict certain flower spieces.
